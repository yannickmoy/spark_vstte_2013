"Requirement ID","Requirement Description","Satisfaction Argument","Satisfied by"
"R.Lookup","The Name Server is supplied with a Domain Name and shall return either the Resource Location, or the Address of another Name Server.","As the Name Server has a valid input and a valid table of data contained within it, and is following the DNS protocol \cite{RFC1035}, it will correctly answer such queries.","S.Data, S.Cache, S.Cache.Old, S.Lookup, S.Lookup.Fail, S.InputFormat, S.Robustness"
"R.Performance","The Name Server must return data in a timely manner.","The use of Cached, but current, data will improve the timeliness of the Name Server. Handling requests in parallel will avoid blocking problems.","S.Lookup, S.Cache, S.Cache.Old, S.Async"
"R.Accuracy","The Name Server must not use any stale data.","As the Name Server will honor the TTL field, we will not use stale data.","S.Cache.Old"
"R.ReverseLookup","The Name Server must be capable of being supplied with the Address of a resource and then returning the Domain Name, or the Address of another Domain Server","As the Name Server has a valid input and a valid table of data contained within it, and is following the DNS protocol \cite{RFC1035}, it will correctly answer such queries.","S.Data, S.Cache, S.Cache.Old, S.Lookup, S.Lookup.Fail, S.InputFormat, S.Robustness"
"R.Refresh","The Name Server must be capable of having its contents refreshed.","We will periodically read and validate the zone file.","S.ReadZoneFile, S.ZoneFileValidation, S.ZoneFilePoll"
"R.RefreshFormat","Any refresh information supplied to the Name Server should be in format that is a subset of the djbdns format.","Following the format specification as outlined in the competition implements a subset of the djbdns file format.","S.ZoneFileValidation, S.ZoneFileFormat.1, S.ZoneFileFormat.2, S.ZoneFileFormat.3, S.ZoneFileFormat.4"
"R.RefreshAvailability","The Name Server should remain available whilst the contents of the server are being refreshed from the Server.","The Name Server will only upload data into the server after it has been fully validated, thus ensuring that the server has correct data. Doing this in a separate thread from all the other processing ensures the server can still operate and serve requests if it refreshes.","S.ZoneFileLoad, S.ZoneFileValidation, S.Async"
"R.ErrorLogging","Errors in the zone file should be logged and not included in the database.","Whenever we process a zone file and find errors, we will log them.","S.ZoneFileLoad, S.ZoneFileValidation, S.Syslog"
