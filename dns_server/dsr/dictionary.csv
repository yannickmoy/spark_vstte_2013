"Term","Definition"
"Address","A 32 bit Internet address. \cite{RFC1035}"
"Cached Data","Previous data retreived as a result of recent Resolver queries on the Name Server, and held with the Name Server to speed up susequent queries."
"Domain Name","A Human-readable label for a resource."
"Domain Space","The domain name space, which is a specification for a tree structured
name space.  Conceptually, each node and leaf of the domain name space
tree names a set of information, and query operations are attempts to
extract specific types of information from a particular set.  A query
names the domain name of interest and describes the type of resource
information that is desired.  For example, the ARPA Internet uses some
of its domain names to identify hosts; queries for address resources
return ARPA Internet host addresses.  However, to preserve the
generality of the domain mechanism, domain names are not required to
have a one-to-one correspondence with host names, host addresses, or
any other type of information. \cite{RFC1034}"
"Name Server","Name servers are server programs which hold information about the
domain tree's structure and set information.  A name server may cache
structure or set information about any part of the domain tree, but in
general a particular name server has complete information about a
subset of the domain space, and pointers to other name servers that
can be used to lead to information from any part of the domain tree.
Name servers know the parts of the domain tree for which they have
complete information; these parts are called zones; a name server is
an authority for these parts of the name space. \cite{RFC1034}"
"Zones","A zone is the complete database for a particular ""pruned"" subtree of the domain space. \cite{RFC1035}"
"Resolver","A program that extracts information from name servers in response to user requests. \cite{RFC1035}"
