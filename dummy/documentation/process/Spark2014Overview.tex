\label{SPARK2014OVERVIEW}

SPARK is one of the premier environments for industrial development of critical
software. It consists of an Ada-based programming and specification language
and associated verification tools that provide support for compositional,
software-contract based specification and verification for both functional and
information flow properties. Since its inception over 20 years ago, continuous
research and development has enabled SPARK to establish an enviable industrial
track-record in the development of the most safety and security-critical
systems.

Despite its significant benefits, the most widely used versions of SPARK (SPARK
2005 and predecessors) suffer from some limitations: contracts are embedded in
comments, the language subset supported for formal verification is limited, and
SPARK's contract language only has a logical interpretation (not an
accompanying executable interpretation).

To overcome these limitations, the next version of SPARK to be issued in 2014
aligns SPARK with Ada 2012, thus providing native support for contracts with
very powerful contract expressions, whose semantics are unified between the
logical and executable views.

The GNAT compiler for Ada supports most of SPARK 2014 constructs already.
The accompanying formal verification tool GNATprove co-developed between
AdaCore and Altran is currently available as a prototype.
