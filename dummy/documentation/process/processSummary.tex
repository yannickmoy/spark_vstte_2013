The swimlane diagram shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:the_process} on page
~\pageref{fig:the_process} has three classes of swimlane:

\begin{itemize}

   \item Development Artefacts - these are items that are either consumed or generated by
         a process activity. This will include the solution to the problem, together with
         the design and test artefacts produced during the creation of the solution.

   \item Development Activites - these are the tasks to be performed to address the
         development goals of the project. The development activities are split across
         swimlanes representing different Team Member rolls within the project:

         \begin{itemize}
            \item Requirements Engineer
            \item Development Engineer
            \item Test Engineer
         \end{itemize}

    The development steps in the swimlane diagram are part of the applied techniques
    listed below :

         \begin{itemize}
            \item \reveal\ - Development Context Diagram; Elicit Requirements; Boundary
            identification; Develop Project Data Model; Develop Domain, Specification,
            Requirements and Satisfaction Argument.
            \item \informed\ - Develop \informed\ Architecture; Apportion requirements to
            Architectural components; Develop UML Diagrams (Optional).
            \item SPARK2014 code development - Refine Specification statements based upon
            architectural structure; Develop Code, Statically Analyse Code; Develop
            High-Level Test Conditions; Develop AUnit High-Level Test Cases; Develop Module
            Test Conditions; Develop Module Tests and relevant stubs; Exceute Tests.
         \end{itemize}

    Prior to the execution of the project two activities have been applied, these are: Process
    Definition and Tool Selection.  Process design is applied to all \altran\ projects, and is
    tailored to select Procedures and Processes from a library of techniques, and is intended
    to produce an optimal mechanism to deliver the solution.

    \item Infrastructure - identifies the tools used in the solution of the problem.
\end{itemize}
