\subsection{\informed\ Main Program}

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{1.75cm}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[main] at (0, 0) {main};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{wrapfigure}
This section show you how an \informed\ Main Program is represented
pictorially on an architecture diagram, and as a SPARK package.

Typically, the SPARK implementation of an \informed\ design will have
only one such main program (annotated with SPARK's
\texttt{main\textunderscore program} annotation).

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=An \informed\ SPARK Main program]
with A, B, C, D;

procedure Main
  with Global => (Input => (I1, I2, I3),
                  Output => (O1, O2))
is
begin  -- Main
   Initialize;
   loop
      ControlProcedure;
   end loop;
end Main;
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{\informed\ Variable Packages}

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{1.5cm}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \node[var] at (0, 0) {Variable};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{wrapfigure}

This section show you how an \informed\ Variable Package is
represented pictorially on an architecture diagram, and as a SPARK
package.

Rather than provide a generic example, this section uses a Stack
package to provides a concrete example of an \informed\ variable
package. In this example we are defining a container
(\texttt{Stack.State}) that can contain values of a certain shape
("abstract stack") upon which certain operations can be performed
(\texttt{Clear}, \texttt{Push} and \texttt{Pop}).


\begin{lstlisting}[caption=An \informed\ SPARK variable package]
package Stack
  with Abstract_State => State
is

  procedure Clear;
    with Global => (Output => State);

  procedure Push(X : in Integer);
    with Global => (In_Out => State);

  procedure Pop(X : out Integer);
    with Global => (In_Out => State);

end Stack;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{\informed\ Type Packages}

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{1.5cm}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[type] at (0, 0) {Type};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{wrapfigure}

This section show you how an \informed\ Type Package is represented
pictorially on an architecture diagram, and as a SPARK package. This
type of package does not have a state and therefore does not require a
State declaration, and this is shown in the code below.

The stack variable package presented earlier can be restructured as a
type package declaring an abstract type.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=An \informed\ SPARK Type Package]
package Stack is

  type T is private;

  procedure Clear (S : out T);

  procedure Push (X : in     Integer;
                  S : in out T);

  procedure Pop (X : out    Integer;
                 S : in out T);

private

  -- full declaration of type T would go here

end Stack;
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{\informed\ Utility Packages}

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{1.75cm}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[utility] at (0, 0) {Utility};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{wrapfigure}

This section show you how an \informed\ Utility Package is represented
pictorially on an architecture diagram. No example of a SPARK Utility
package is provided here since these are of such a general nature.

However, care should be taken when implementing an \informed\ design
as it is easy for there to be an excessive proliferation of
packages. In many cases the correct place for an operation is in the
type or variable pacakage upon which it operates. The key thing for an
\informed\ design is for the operations to be correctly located.

\subsection{\informed\ Boundary Variable Packages}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{1.75cm}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[boundary,text width=1.5cm] at (0, 0) {Boundary};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{wrapfigure}

This section show you how an \informed\ Boundary Variable Package is
represented pictorially on an architecture diagram, and as a SPARK
package.

A boundary variable is a variable package; however, unlike other
instances of such variables the name provided in its own variable
clause is a place holder representing the stream of data arriving
from, or being sent tom the outside world rather than simply an
abstract name for the internal state of the package.

It is often useful to place an abstraction layer between the boundary
variables of a system and their users; this approach is appropriate
where direct use of the boundary variables would provide insufficient
abstraction allowing too much detail to become visable in higher level
SPARK annotations. An example of this abstraction layer is include in
the code example shown below.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=An \informed\ SPARK Boundary Variable Package]
package Controls
  with Abstract_State => (Start, Stop, Reset)
is

  procedure Read_Start_State (Is_Pressed : out Boolean)
    with Global => (Input => Start);

  procedure Read_Stop_State (Is_Pressed : out Boolean)
    with Global => (Input => Stop);

  procedure Read_Reset_State (Is_Pressed : out Boolean)
    with Global => (Input => Reset);

end Controls;

with Controls;
private package Controls.Reset
   with Abstract_State => (Reset)
is
  procedure Read (Is_Pressed : out Boolean)
    with Global => (Input => Reset);
end Controls.Reset;

with Controls;
private package Controls.Start
   with Abstract_State => (Start)
is
  procedure Read (Is_Pressed : out Boolean)
    with Global => (Input => Start);
end Controls.Start;

with Controls;
private package Controls.Stop
   with Abstract_State => (Stop)
is
  procedure Read (Is_Pressed : out Boolean)
    with Global => (Input => Stop);
end Controls.Stop;

\end{lstlisting}
